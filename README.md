# Online Reservation System in Java

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Online Reservation System** built using Java. This console-based application allows users to make, view, and cancel reservations. It streamlines the reservation process, making it convenient for users to manage bookings. Businesses can benefit from this system by improving efficiency, reducing workload, and providing a better customer experience. This project demonstrates how to implement a simple yet effective reservation system using core Java concepts and OOP principles.

## Features
- **Make a Reservation**: Users can input details like name, date, and number of guests to create a reservation. The system assigns a unique ID to each booking.
- **View Reservations**: The system displays a list of all current reservations, including the reservation ID, name, date, and number of guests.
- **Cancel Reservation**: Users can cancel a reservation by entering the corresponding reservation ID.
- **Exit**: Users can exit the application at any time.

## Components
The project consists of three main classes:
1. **Reservation Class**: Manages individual reservations with properties such as name, date, and number of guests.
2. **Reservation System Class**: Handles operations like adding, viewing, and canceling reservations using an ArrayList.
3. **Reservation System UI**: A simple console-based interface that interacts with users, enabling them to perform actions like making, viewing, and canceling reservations.

## Technologies Used
- Java
